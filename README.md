# Hi there 👋
I'm a final year undergraduate student with a passion for Machine Learning and Quantum Computing. They say that Machine Learning is the future, but I say it's already here! And don't even get me started on Quantum Computing - the idea that a qubit can exist in a superposition of states simultaneously blows my mind!

## Skills 👨‍💻
- Machine Learning: I can train a computer to tell you if a picture is a cat or a dog! (Just don't ask me to tell you which breed it is...)
- Quantum Computing: I can write a program that simulates the behavior of a qubit... in theory, at least!
- Programming Languages: I'm fluent in Python, Java, C and C++, but I still have trouble with English sometimes...

## Current Education 👨‍🏫
-	Bachelors of Technology Degree in Computer Science and Engineering (expected graduation: June 2023)

## Interests 🤩
I'm fascinated by the infinite possibilities that arise when Machine Learning meets Quantum Computing. I mean, who knows, maybe we can use it to finally solve the mystery of whether or not there's life on other planets. Or, more realistically, we can use it to create the perfect Frozen Dessert recipe as Ice-Cream.
